  abstract = {In spite of the availability of most proficient quality assurance teams and tools, software testing has always been a time-consuming task. Thus test automation is being profoundly practiced in most of the software industries to leverage the total development time. Although the test automation has its own advantages and disadvantages and it influences various other development phases, the higher management is particularly interested in reckoning its effects on total software's cost, quality and time. In this paper, we have tried to ascertain some of the critical factors related to test automation and cost/return of/from automation. As automation is itself a pricy activity, it requires development effort and significant time, we have attempted to enumerate test automation's impacts on software's cost, time and quality on three different softwares. The results of our experiments clearly show the positive effects of test automation on cost, quality and time to market of the software.}

  abstract = {The goal of any business is to satisfy the needs of its target customers, and IT industry is not an exception from that rule. Thus, the upgraded version of the V-model testing is supposed to deal with the weaknesses of the original version in question by combining it with the method known as agile testing. At the beginning of the report, hypothesis such as the strengths and weaknesses of the existing V-model testing via literature review and interviews with respective specialists in the sphere were analysed. Successively, the possible advantages of agile method of testing were then considered. Moreover, the report comes up with the ways in which the two models could be naturally combined to produce a much more effective one. Once the new model was presented, its strengths and weaknesses were assessed by the means of a case study analysis using metric and a data analysis through a survey were conducted to evaluate the credibility of the futurist model. Promptly, the research found that the suggested testing model provides better results than the common version of V-model testing. Firstly, a real case scenarios under metric evaluation of the models have indicated that the proposed model is better than the V-model, since it can handle the following aspects; reduced testing time, debugging, prioritization of requirements, easy mapping of roles and improved visibility of project resources. Secondly, a survey data analysis highlighted various advantages of the future model. The top priorities of the new model from the respondent’s perception were; the new model manages rapidly changing priorities, it accelerates time to market, it increases productivity and it improves quality.}

  abstract = {The real-time industrial network, often referred to as fieldbus, is an important element for building automated manufacturing systems. Thus, in order to satisfy the real-time requirements of field devices such as sensors, actuators, and controllers, numerous standard organizations and vendors have developed various fieldbus protocols. As a result, the IEC 61158 standard, including Profibus, WorldFIP, and Foundation Fieldbus, was recently announced as an international standard. These fieldbus protocols have an important advantage over the widely used Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) in terms of the deterministic characteristics. However, the application of fieldbus has been limited due to the high cost of hardware and the difficulty in interfacing with multivendor products. In order to solve these problems, the computer network technology, especially Ethernet, is being adopted by the industrial automation field. The key technical obstacle for Ethernet for industrial applications is that its nondeterministic behavior makes it inadequate for real-time applications, where the frames containing real-time information, such as control command and alarm signal, have to be delivered within a certain time limit. Recently, the development of switched Ethernet shows a very promising prospect for industrial applications due to the elimination of uncertainties in the network operation that leads to the dramatically improved performance. This paper focuses on the application of the switched Ethernet for industrial communications. More specifically, this paper presents the performance evaluation of the switched Ethernet on an experimental network testbed along with an implementation method for using the switched Ethernet for industrial automation.}
